## Identification of tissue-specific immunosuppressive domains in the human genome

### Project objectives

1. Scan a latest version of human proteome with the ISDTool 2.0 utility
2. Preprocess an input file with a description of hypothetical immunosuppressive peptides and obtain FASTA file with sequences of this peptides
3. Search peptide sequences in a six-frame genome translation database
4. Perform tissue-specific analysis of found sequences using transcriptome databases
